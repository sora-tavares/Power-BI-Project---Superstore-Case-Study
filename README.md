## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores sales performance and customer behaviour for a fictional retail chain using the **Superstore dataset**. Built in Power BI, the dashboard combines clean visuals, slicer interactivity, and segmentation logic to uncover actionable opportunities in customer engagement and profitability.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which regions, segments, and product categories drive the most profit?
- How does customer behavior vary across Recency, Frequency, and Monetary dimensions?
- What customer segments are most valuable — and which are at risk?
- How can we translate insights into data-driven business actions?

---

## 🧠 Analytical Highlights

- Applied **RFM Segmentation** to 4,700+ customers using DAX logic
- Found that over **60% of customers** were active in the past 30 days
- Identified **high-frequency, high-monetary** customers for loyalty targeting
- Flagged **low-recency, low-spend** segments as churn risks

## 🖼️ Dashboard Previews

### 📌 Sales Overview

![Sales Overview](Assets/sales_overview_screenshot.png)  
*High-level performance metrics with dynamic filters*

The West region generated the highest sales, but had lower profit margins compared to Central. The Corporate segment consistently outperformed in profit contribution. Technology products drove the most revenue.
